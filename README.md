# Blog

## Why blog?

Developers, their teams, and others in them, often write blogs about their work and interests. 

Motivations for doing this are many, but may include a desire to share work and get feedback, develop a reputation and influence within a community, or attract talent / find new work. 

## Challenges 

Common challenges facing solo developers and teams writing blogs include:

- choosing a platform that supports popular technologies like React and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- finding a workflow that supports working collaboratively on posts
- automating build and publish steps

## Why Modify?

Modify solves these challenges in a few ways:

- allows you to author in markdown/MDX and choose whatever static site generator / framework you like
- provides real-time collaboration for creating and reviewing posts
- jobs with examples provide detailed steps on how to set up and run build and publish pipelines

## Posts 

This repo contains a selection of dummy posts. This is an early iteration that is likely to change as the beta progresses.
